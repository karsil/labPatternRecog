\section*{Exercise T-3.1}
Consider a two-category classification problem and show that - in a
specific case - the decision boundary for a MAP classifier is given by setting the log-likelihood ratio to zero. What is the special condition required in that case?

\subsection*{Solution:}
As of the formula for $g(x)$:
\begin{align}
	g(x)=ln\frac{P(x|\omega_1)}{P(x|\omega_2)}+ln\frac{P(\omega_1)}{P(\omega_2)}
\end{align}
The log-likelihood-ratio can be 0 when the ratio of the two possibilities is 1. This is only the case, when $P(\omega_1)=P(\omega_2)$.
