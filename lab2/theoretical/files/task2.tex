\section*{Exercise T-2.2}

\subsection*{Problem}
The Census Bureau has estimated the following survival probabilities for men:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item probability that a man lives at least 70 years: 80 \%
	\item probability that a man lives at least 80 years: 50 \%
\end{enumerate}

What is the conditional probability that a man lives at least 80 years given that he has just celebrated his 70th birthday?

\subsection*{Solution}

$p(s)$: man lives at least \textbf{s}eventy years\\
$p(e)$: man lives at least \textbf{e}ighty years\\

$p(s|e) = 1$ (no man can live 80 years if he died before living 70 years)\\
$p(e|s) = \frac{p(s|e)\cdot p(e)}{p(s)} = \frac{1\cdot 0.5}{0.8} = 0.625$\\
The conditional probability that a man lives at least 80 years given that he has just celebrated his 70th birthday is at 62.5\%.
